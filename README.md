# Aviation Accident Database & Synopses, up to 2023
## Introduction.
### Business understanding
A company is embarking on a strategic expansion into the aviation sector, aiming to diversify its investment portfolio by purchasing and operating planes for both commercial and private enterprises. As this venture is new to the organisation, there is limited internal knowledge about the aviation domain, particularly regarding safety and operational risk.

### Business problem
The company must identify which aircraft models and types have the lowest operational risk to guide safe and cost-effective entry into the aviation market.

### EDA objectives
This notebook explores aircraft risk patterns to support the Company's on safe aircraft acquisition decisions. The following objectives are structured around key EDA phases:

**Data understanding**

Load and preview the dataset to understand its structure, size and key variables.
Identify the most relevant columns for analyzing aviation safety.
**Data cleaning**

Handle missing values and duplicated values.
Check on inconsistent formatting in the key fields.
Standardize categorical variables for accurate grouping.
Check on outliers.......
**Univariate & Bivariate Analysis**

Explore the most common aircraft types and count how many incidents each has.
Analyze incident trends over time to detect rising or declining risk patterns
**Multivariate & Grouped Insights**

Compare incident frequencies by usage type (commercial vs private), age, or manufacturer.
**Incident Causes & Locations**

Visualize the top causes of incidents and the regions with the highest incident density.
